Charles River Tycoon — Quick Run

Files:
- `index.html` — The game page (created from the workspace file `import time.py`).

Open locally (macOS):

```bash
# change to the directory containing the files
cd /Users/subahanfakir/Downloads/test

# open the game in your default browser
open index.html
```

Or right-click `index.html` in Finder and choose "Open With → [browser]".

Notes:
- No webserver required; this runs locally as a static page.
- If icons do not appear, ensure internet access (Font Awesome CDN is used).
- If you want, I can also remove the original `import time.py` or convert it into a backup file.
